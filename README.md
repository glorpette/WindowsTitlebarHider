# Windows Titlebar Hider

A mod that forcefully hides the Windows titlebar, in case of Komorebi or any other tiling WM being used.
You can use this to maximize the game and make the window appear as if it's in fullscreen without entering fullscreen mode (borderless window mode).

- Works only on Windows
- You can use `Windows + Up` key to maximize the game window while the title bar is hidden

This is a fork of the original mod WindowTitlebarDelete by wvvern1.
